**Why these metrics?**

Tech stocks should be valued based on liquidity, financial leverage, and future profitability. Liquidity is important as tech companies often have short-term obligations that are critical to the growth of the company and those obligations cost money so liquid assets are important. Financial leverage is important because tech companies often have a large amount of debt which is not inherently a bad thing but metrics like the debt to equity ratio allow an investor to monitor and make sure the debt isn't too much that the company may become insolvent before making a profit for investors. The last ratio included in this curated list only applies to companies pulling in revenue. Gross profit margin shows the investor the ability for the company to be profitable. A low gross profit margin shows that it costs the company a lot of money to produce the current amount of sales and therefore is not very profitable.
