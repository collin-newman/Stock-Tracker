There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Tech company financial analysis

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Get all the relevant informantion for conducting fundamental analysis on a tech company all in one place.

## Summary ##
  > There are all sorts of metrics that can be looked at when doing fundamental analysis but no all companies are the same and you must choose the right metrics for the right company. You wouldn't use the same metrics for evaluating Walmart (a major retailer) that you would for evaluating a small tech company on the brink of profitability. The aim of this app is to provide you with just enough *relevant* metrics to be able to quickly make an informed decision on a company.

## Problem ##
  > The stock market is attracting a younger and younger crowd now a days. This isn't inherintly a problem in itself but it created the problem of an over reliance on technical analysis. Young traders almost exclusively trade on technicals because thats what they see on instagram. Its a lot easier for instagram traders to post a screenshot of some crazy looking chart with lines all over the place and telling people to buy this stock now than to post and analysis of the companies financial. Financials are ignored with the new younger crowd.

## Solution ##
  > This app takes the difficulty out of fundamental research. The young traders like trading on technicals because its easy. They can set up their chart with 3-5 indicators and then all they have to do is tell the chart what stock ticker to look at. This app takes the ease of technical research and applies it to fundamental research.

## Quote from You ##
  > "Fast and effective fundamentals. Get up to date with your entire watch list's fundamentals before you're even done with your first cup of coffee."

## How to Get Started ##
